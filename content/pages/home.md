## Why SARDINE?

A **[sardine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sardine)** (*sardina pilchardus*, "sardinha" in Portuguese) is a fish commonly found in the Northeast Atlantic and Mediterranean, where it inhabits the water column in coastal zones between 25-100 m of depth.
It has an elongated body covered with scales, with a darker blue-silvery coloured back and lighter silvery coloured sides and belly.
It spawns from October to April when it is leaner, and females can release 50,000 to 60,000 eggs.
Sardines are a much appreciated delicacy in [Portugal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal), most prominently at city summer festivals such as [Santo António festival](https://beportugal.com/lisbon-sardine-festival) in [Lisbon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisbon).
