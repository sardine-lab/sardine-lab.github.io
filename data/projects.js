  "description": `<p>The DECOLLAGE project aims to overcome fundamental limitations of today’s large-scale language models by combining advances in machine learning, sparse modeling, information theory, and cognitive science. It pursues three core directions: developing mechanisms for self-assessment and contextualization, designing dynamic memory structures for continual learning, and creating mathematical models for sparse communication that bridge symbolic and continuous representations across modalities. By integrating these innovations, DECOLLAGE seeks to build modular, efficient, and cognitively inspired architectures, ultimately enabling more adaptive, context-aware, and intelligent systems for demanding language generation tasks such as machine translation and open-ended text generation.</p>`

  "description": `<p>The UTTER project advances online and hybrid interaction by developing extended reality (XR) technologies that seamlessly integrate human and AI agents in conversation platforms. It focuses on creating intelligent assistants for meetings and customer support, capable of real-time multilingual translation, summarization, minuting, and multimodal dialogue support. Through innovations in XR model efficiency, usability, and adaptability across languages and domains, UTTER will deliver new resources such as multilingual datasets and pretrained models, alongside prototypes including a meeting assistant with live captioning and summaries, and a multilingual customer support assistant enhanced with quality estimates and emotion tracking.</p>`

  "description": `<p>The <strong>MAIA</strong> project is rooted in a vibrant ecosystem fostered by <strong><a href="https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/">Instituto Superior Técnico (IST)</a></strong> and the <a href="https://cmuportugal.org">CMU-Portugal Program</a>, an enduring collaboration between Carnegie Mellon University and Portuguese research institutions that has bolstered Portugal’s innovation in ICT, AI, and machine learning since 2006. This initiative, supported by CMU-Portugal’s industry–academia partnerships and significant R&amp;D funding, has incubated several successful startups—including <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unbabel">Unbabel</a></strong>, a Lisbon-based AI-powered human-in-the-loop translation platform. Unbabel, born from CMU-Portugal’s research ecosystem, leads the MAIA project to develop multilingual virtual agents that enhance customer service by assisting human agents with context-aware translation, response suggestions, and emotionally intelligent quality assessment—demonstrating the powerful synergy between IST’s academic expertise, CMU-Portugal’s innovation framework, and Unbabel’s applied technology leadership.</p>`

  "description": `<p>The <strong>DeepSPIN</strong> project (“Deep Structured Prediction in Natural Language Processing”), funded by the European Research Council (ERC) and coordinated by André Martins at <strong><a href="https://www.it.pt/">Instituto de Telecomunicações</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/">Instituto Superior Técnico</a></strong> in collaboration with <strong><a href="https://unbabel.com/">Unbabel</a></strong>, explored new ways to combine deep learning with structured prediction between 2018 and 2023. Tackling the limitations of current neural NLP systems—which often ignore the structural complexity of language and make critical errors in tasks like machine translation—DeepSPIN developed novel approaches for integrating planning mechanisms, latent structure induction, and weak supervision into neural networks. These advances aimed to make NLP systems more expressive, interpretable, and efficient, with applications tested in machine translation, quality estimation, and dependency parsing, and with strong ties to real-world impact through Unbabel’s multilingual translation platforms.</p>`
